1. **Time complexity**
	Determines how long an operation would take depending on the input 
2. **Space complexity**
	Determines total amount of memory used

#### There are 3 main methodologies to estimate algorithms' complexity:
1. Big O notation shows the worst case scenario
2. Big Ω notation estimates the best possible scenario
3. Big Θ notation calculates median of big O and big Ω notations (more accurate estimation)

Big O notation is the most popular method for complexity estimation.

#### **Main complexity functions:**
1. [[Constant O(1)]]
2. [[Logarithmic О(log(n))]]
3. [[Linear О(n)]]
4. [[Linear-logarithmic О(n*log(n))]]
5. [[Quadratic O(n^2)]]
6. [[Exponential О(2^n)]]
7. [[Factorial О(n!)]]
